                <p> My name is April Copes and I am a Fullstack JavaScript Software Developer. Prior to pursuing a career in software development, I was 
                    an industrial electrician for an automation conveyor installations company. There I learned how to plan, organize, and integrate 
                    critical electrical engineering upgrades to major distribution centers such as Amazon, FedEx, Walmart, and Walgreens throughout the US.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    I have a deep desire to understand how the components of complex systems work in unison to create a more fluid and robust experience for both the 
                    client and team members involved. Apart from my immense passion for technology, I genuinely am at my best when working alongside others to develop, 
                    strategize, and implement needed solutions. I seek and welcome challenge as I appreciate the rewards that come from being a part of a great team.

                <p>Intent Manifesto is an app that focuses on helping users actualize their goals and dreams into reality. 
                    By treating their thoughts as more than just a task to be crossed off a list, the user can now store all those amazing ideas in a place that is just for them. Intent Manifesto is a personal collection of a user's most intimate thoughts and ideas. Though it can be used for any purpose the user deems fit, the app was created with goal-oriented 
                    people in mind.
                </p>

                <p>This fullstack application was built by April Copes and Lauren Wilkerson with the intention of creating a space 
                    for others that influence those to go after their goals and dreams. The technologies used to build this app were HTML, CSS, 
                    JavaScript, Node.js/Express, and SQL. Intent Manifesto is currently viewable on GitHub and feedback and contributions are welcomed and encouraged.
